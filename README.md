# Product and Category Management REST Controller

This my first spring boot project to learn spring framework. while writing this project I learned best practices for project structure, code structure,ensure the code is loosely coupled and that all the layers in the application are completely independent of each other and talk using neutral objects.

I have used pure JDBC classes to implement this project.

I have also provided pagination api using pure JDBC classes.

Learnings:

JDBC

Collections

Dependency injection

HTTP methods and code

REST request and response

SQL queries

Centralized exception handling

Used MYSQL Database
